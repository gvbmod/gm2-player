# Gvbvdxx Mod 2 - Project Player.

An attempt to replace the current GvbvdxxMod2HTML with a better programed one.

# Current features:

Variables are actually positioned right now.

Support with most TurboWarp extensions (with working overlay features!).

# May be added?

Video sensing extension support.

Fix the variable colors (small issue, does not effect anything).
